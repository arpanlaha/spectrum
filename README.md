# Spectrum

## Background

The patterns generated by Spectrum are inspired by my submission to [CS 225's MP1 Part 3](https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs225/fa2018/mps/1/#part-3-getting-creative), which involes using the [HSL color space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV) to generate artwork.

Spectrum uses three different rendering methods:

- WebGL + WebAssembly
- WebAssembly only (`2d` canvas rendering context)
- JavaScript only (`2d` canvas rendering context)

This originated as a way for me to test out Rust with WebAssembly, but after seeing the limitations of a CPU-only render (the WebAssembly-only implementation), I decided to try out implementing the same logic in WebGL to better understand the benefits of GPU-accelerated rendering. To illustrate the benefits of WebAssembly, I also created the JavaScript-only implementation as a comparison.
